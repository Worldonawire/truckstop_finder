## Introduction

Welcome to the Truck Stop API showing you America's truck stops and their amenities. On the frontend is Google map api UI 
which accesses multiple endpoints to show you locations of various truckstops, addresses, amenities, and more. 

This app features a customer UI/UX experience, tailored for the young posh client truckers. 

In this readme, I will provide you with more details the available endpoints as well as frontend usage instructions.
