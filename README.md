# TruckStopApi 

## Preface

This project is more complex than what you have seen before. It is supposed to mimic you graduating, getting your first job, being asked to handle a certain task. It is **normal** to feel overwhelmed.

Here are some pointers to help you through this:

- In bigger projects, you either have another team or developers work on separate tasks and parts of the project, so you do not need to and can not spend time trying to understand everything
- You will have a certain task, prioritize finding out _where_ in the code base you have to work on
- VSCode is your best friend, use `Ctrl/CMD + P` to quickly navigate through files, searching for terms like "migration", to help you find what you need
- You will need to get comfortable not knowing everything, keep in mind: CONJURE, CONJURE, CONJURE

## Objectives

- Understanding the concepts of building a full-stack application
- Understanding database migrations and how they work in the context of connecting with a frontend
- Hands on building full-stack API that supports get requests
